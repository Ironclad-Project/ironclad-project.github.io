<p>Scheduling in Ironclad is based broadly on
<a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_653">ARINC 653 partitioning</a> and
process models. Like the standard specifies, it employs 2 hierarchies of
schedulable entities, the thread cluster, and the thread (or partition and
process in ARINC nomenclature respectively).
</p>
<p>Each cluster needs to have a percentage of CPU time assigned at creation
(which can be modified later on), that the scheduler will uphold with
preemption, effectively promissing that any given cluster will be given, at
least, the specified execution time. Validy of the cluster configuration is
checked when adding, deleting, or modifying individual clusters.
</p>
<p>Slack time (time not covered percent-wise by any cluster) will be used as seen
fit, while not breaking scheduler guarantees, in an unspecified way. Thus, it
shall be treated as <b class="b">UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR</b> by system users, and it is the
responsability of the user to configure the scheduling to keep this into
account. It is also why the above paragraph mentions &quot;at least&quot;, as unspecified
time can be assigned to other clusters.
</p>
<p>Ironclad supports multicore configurations, shuffling cores around clusters,
while always keeping the assigned slices for each cluster.
