      <h1>Takao, the Ironclad seal</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Takao</b> is the pet and icon of Ironclad, and it is meant to
        represent the operating system kernel, not any other aspect of the
        project, like its community, or corporate shenanigans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Takao image's copyright is owned by streaksu. Permission to use Takao's
        likeness is granted for non-exclusive use to label anything related to
        Ironclad. Distributions of Ironclad or forks of the project are free
        to use their own logos and/or mascots as well as Takao.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain variants are also permissible, like changing Takao's
        facial expression, or attire. The patches of the coat are important
        though, the shape of them should stay the same for easier recognition,
        but that's ultimately up to you.

      <h2>Takao's History</h2>
      <p>
        Takao got their name from a previous operating system project of mine
        that, in many ways, was the beginning of Ironclad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Takao, the seal, was also the pet of Takao, the operating system. With
        the advent of Ironclad, and a little change of coat, Takao also became
        the pet of Ironclad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once Ironclad started being featured in presentations and stickers, the
        rugged borders and low-res PNG format made it difficult to modify and
        use. Thus, a face lift was due! Resulting in the new stylized version
        that nowadays represents Ironclad.
