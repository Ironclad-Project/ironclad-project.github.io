      <h1>Contributing</h1>
      <p>
         Thanks for considering contributing to Ironclad, it means a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
         There are several ways one can help the Ironclad project, from writing
         and correcting documentation to contributing source code. A great way
         to help Ironclad as well is sharing it with people that may find it
         interesting!
      </p>
      <h2>Bug Reporting</h2>
      <p>
         One can report bugs to the
         <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=ironclad">Bug tracker</a>
         (<a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=ironclad&func=additem">Submit directly here</a>),
         or to the project's <a href="community.html">mailing lists</a> as well.
      </p>
      <p>

        information:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>What version or commit are you using?</li>
         <li>What did you do when the bug happened?</li>
         <li>What exactly did you see then?</li>
         <li>Do you have some internal kernel state available?</li>
         <li>Is the problem ongoing or reproduceable?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      <h2>Finding what to contribute</h2>
      <p>
        For all of Ironclad's projects, like <code>ironclad</code> itself, this website, and <code>util-ironclad</code>,
        open tasks, along with their progress, effort required, and priority,
        are tracked on the
        <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/task/?group=ironclad">Savannah task manager</a>
        (<a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/task/?group=ironclad&func=additem">Submit a new item</a>).
        Feel free to read the available items to give input, take the lead and
        contribute, or submit your own items.
      </p>
      <h2>Testing changes</h2>
      <p>
        For testing changes to Ironclad itself, one will need a system running
        Ironclad. Our recommendation is using
        <a href="https://github.com/streaksu/Gloire">Gloire</a> in a virtual
        machine or real hardware to test modifications. For a guide on how
        to modify Gloire's Ironclad, building images with custom kernels, and
        testing them, please check
        <a href="https://github.com/streaksu/Gloire/wiki/Developing-Ironclad-inside-Gloire">this article</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Submitting changes</h2>
      <p>
        One can send a patch to any of the Ironclad's
        <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=ironclad">Patch Manager</a>
        (<a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=ironclad&func=additem">create an item</a>)
        or the project's <a href="community.html">mailing lists</a> as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        When submitting contributions, only contributions licensed under
        the GPL, or alternatively, a GPL-compatible license, will be accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to ensure this is the case, submitted patches will need to
        certify their work by accepting the project's
        <a href="https://developercertificate.org/">Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)</a>.
        This is done by either adding <code>Signed-off-by</code> to the patch,
        either manually or using git's <code>-s</code> flag, or by stating
        compliance in the patch submission.
      </p>
      <div class="notice-panel">
        <h3>DCOs are not CLAs!</h3>
        <p>
          DCOs do no copyright assignment, and the
          contributor keeps each and every right over their contribution.
          Individual contributor copyright is one of the core pillars of free
          software. This process only gives a bit of legal shielding for the
          project if that is not the case.

      <h2>Development contact</h2>
      <p>
        Ironclad has several mailing lists and official servers and services
        for users as well as developers to talk with each other and coordinate,
        feel free to check them out at
        <a href="community.html">the community page</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Userland development</h2>
      <p>
        A kernel is really dependent on its user programs. Here is a list of
        projects that are a great option to get involved with, without having
        to do kernel development:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/streaksu/Gloire">Gloire</a>, an Ironclad distribution using GNU tools.</li>
      </ul>
